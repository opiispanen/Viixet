			<h1>Vue-Express Viixet boilerplate</h1>
			<p>
				Okay okay, we're all hungry but we're all gonna get to our hot plates soon enough.
			</p>
			<p>
				What is this? This is a personal project to build a full stack vue-express-nodejs-mysql
				framework for small project. It's always evolving, maybe not the best idea to pick this 
				up and use in production.
			</p>
			<p>
				The build size might be pretty big (over 150 kb). Consider using CDN services on vendor code
				like Vue itself instead of making a vendor bundle with webpack.
